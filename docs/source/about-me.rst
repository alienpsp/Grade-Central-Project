All about me
############

I've been called many names, but I'll let you decide the coolest one. I'm currently learning Python along with Github and Linux.

To be frank, I've always listed myself in the lazy groups of people but hey, Bill Gates say he'll pick the lazy one to do a hard job because we always find an easy way to do it, which lit my interest in Python and automation(also Thanks Al Swegart).

Being Asian, we have a proverb in Chinese that says "活到老，学到老" which translated into for as long as you live, you learn as you live and I believe there is always something to learn from everyone so join me in the milestone and learn together.
