#Grade Central - Project 

WIP

Here is the final project of the Python Programming for Beginners and how I'll attempt to write a code to run as the scenario explained below and document it with Sphinx document after the project.

Scenario:
Create a student grading system using Python that has the following functionalities:
1. Entering the grades of a student
2. Removing a student from the system
3. Calculating the average grades of a student

The user should be able to select whether he/she wants to remove a student, enter grades for a student of find the average grades.async

Also perform the following as part of this project:
- There should be a log-in system to allow only admin access to the grading system
- Make sure you use dictionaries and lists for storing student's data.
- Us Python functions as much as you can

Example of the snapshots:

Welcome to Grade Central 

[1] - Enter Grades
